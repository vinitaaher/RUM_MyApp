 * - Timing (start, end) are nested inside the request (start, end)
 * - Some timing can be not exactly nested, being off by < 1 ms
 *
 * Strategy:
 * - from valid nested entries (with 1 ms error margin)
 * - if a single timing match, return the timing
 * - otherwise we can't decide, return undefined
